# Mail-with-Spark
Description: This is a simple File Action workflow for Alfred.

Instruction: Enable your buffer in Alfred first. Search the files you want to mail, if more than one, add them to buffer with shortcuts `⌥ + ↑` or `⌥ + ↓`, then use the buffer action shortcuts `⌥ + →` to open the file action, select spark to, and spark opens with all the selected files as your attachments.

This is just a quick file action workflow, not fully tested.<br>

This is a fork of the workflow created by Shana601, as discussed here:<br>
https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/8821-default-email-client-when-sending-files/

Prior to finding Shana's workflow I also updated and installed an AppleScript by GuiB in the same thread. I never got that working, but my version is posted there in case anyone finds that it is necessary to make this workflow work.
